DALL·E Flow is an interactive workflow for generating high-definition images from text prompt. First, it leverages [DALL·E-Mega](https://github.com/borisdayma/dalle-mini) to generate image candidates, and then calls [CLIP-as-service](https://github.com/jina-ai/clip-as-service) to rank the candidates w.r.t. the prompt. The preferred candidate is fed to [GLID-3 XL](https://github.com/Jack000/glid-3-xl) for diffusion, which often enriches the texture and background. Finally, the candidate is upscaled to 1024x1024 via [SwinIR](https://github.com/JingyunLiang/SwinIR).

DALL·E Flow is built with [Jina](https://github.com/jina-ai/jina) in a client-server architecture, which gives it high scalability, non-blocking streaming, and a modern Pythonic interface. Client can interact with the server via gRPC/Websocket/HTTP with TLS.

**Why Human-in-the-Loop?** Generative art is a creative process. While recent advances of DALL·E unleash people's creativity, having a single-prompt-single-output UX/UI locks the imagination to a _single_ possibility, which is bad no matter how fine this single result is. DALL·E Flow is an alternative to the one-liner, by formalizing the generative art as an iterative procedure.

## Usage

DALL·E Flow is in client-server architecture.
- [Client usage](#Client)
- [Server usage, i.e. deploy your own server](#Server)


## Updates

- ⚠️ **2022/5/23** Fix an upstream bug in CLIP-as-service. This bug makes the 2nd diffusion step irrelevant to the given texts. New Dockerfile proved to be reproducible on a AWS EC2 `p2.x8large` instance.
- **2022/5/13b** Removing TLS as Cloudflare gives 100s timeout, making DALLE Flow in usable [Please _reopen_ the notebook in Google Colab!](https://colab.research.google.com/github/jina-ai/dalle-flow/blob/main/client.ipynb).
- 🔐 **2022/5/13** New Mega checkpoint! All connections are now with TLS, [Please _reopen_ the notebook in Google Colab!](https://colab.research.google.com/github/jina-ai/dalle-flow/blob/main/client.ipynb).
- 🐳 **2022/5/10** [A Dockerfile is added! Now you can easily deploy your own DALL·E Flow](#run-in-docker). New Mega checkpoint! Smaller memory-footprint, the whole Flow can now fit into **one GPU with 21GB memory**.
- 🌟 **2022/5/7** New Mega checkpoint & multiple optimization on GLID3: less memory-footprint, use `ViT-L/14@336px` from CLIP-as-service, `steps 100->200`. 
- 🌟 **2022/5/6** DALL·E Flow just got updated! [Please _reopen_ the notebook in Google Colab!](https://colab.research.google.com/github/jina-ai/dalle-flow/blob/main/client.ipynb)
  - Revised the first step: 16 candidates are generated, 8 from DALL·E Mega, 8 from GLID3-XL; then ranked by CLIP-as-service.
  - Improved the flow efficiency: the overall speed, including diffusion and upscaling are much faster now!

## Client

<a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/jina-ai/dalle-flow/blob/main/client.ipynb"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Open-in%20Colab-orange?logo=google-colab&style=flat-square" alt="Open in Google Colab"/></a>

Using client is super easy. The following steps are best run in [Jupyter notebook](./client.ipynb) or [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/jina-ai/dalle-flow/blob/main/client.ipynb).  

You will need to install [DocArray](https://github.com/jina-ai/docarray) and [Jina](https://github.com/jina-ai/jina) first:

```bash
pip install "docarray[common]>=0.13.5" jina
```

We have provided a demo server for you to play:
> ⚠️ **Due to the massive requests, our server may be delay in response. Yet we are _very_ confident on keeping the uptime high.** You can also deploy your own server by [following the instruction here](#server).

```python
server_url = 'grpc://dalle-flow.jina.ai:51005'
```


### Step 1: Generate via DALL·E Mega

Now let's define the prompt:

```python
prompt = 'an oil painting of a humanoid robot playing chess in the style of Matisse'
```

Let's submit it to the server and visualize the results:

```python
from docarray import Document

da = Document(text=prompt).post(server_url, parameters={'num_images': 8}).matches

da.plot_image_sprites(fig_size=(10,10), show_index=True)
```

Here we generate 16 candidates, 8 from DALLE-mega and 8 from GLID3 XL, this is as defined in `num_images`, which takes about ~2 minutes. You can use a smaller value if it is too long for you. 


<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/jina-ai/dalle-flow/blob/main/.github/client-dalle.png?raw=true" width="70%">
</p>

### Step 2: Select and refinement via GLID3 XL

The 16 candidates are sorted by [CLIP-as-service](https://github.com/jina-ai/clip-as-service), with index-`0` as the best candidate judged by CLIP. Of course, you may think differently. Notice the number in the top-left corner? Select the one you like the most and get a better view:

```python
fav_id = 3
fav = da[fav_id]
fav.display()
```

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/jina-ai/dalle-flow/blob/main/.github/client-select1.png?raw=true" width="30%">
</p>

Now let's submit the selected candidates to the server for diffusion.

```python
diffused = fav.post(f'{server_url}', parameters={'skip_rate': 0.5, 'num_images': 36}, target_executor='diffusion').matches

diffused.plot_image_sprites(fig_size=(10,10), show_index=True)
```

This will give 36 images based on the selected image. You may allow the model to improvise more by giving `skip_rate` a near-zero value, or a near-one value to force its closeness to the given image. The whole procedure takes about ~2 minutes.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/jina-ai/dalle-flow/blob/main/.github/client-glid.png?raw=true" width="60%">
</p>

### Step 3: Select and upscale via SwinIR

Select the image you like the most, and give it a closer look:

```python
dfav_id = 34
fav = diffused[dfav_id]
fav.display()
```

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/jina-ai/dalle-flow/blob/main/.github/client-select2.png?raw=true" width="30%">
</p>


Finally, submit to the server for the last step: upscaling to 1024 x 1024px.

```python
fav = fav.post(f'{server_url}/upscale')
fav.display()
```

That's it! It is _the one_. If not satisfied, please repeat the procedure.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/jina-ai/dalle-flow/blob/main/.github/client-select3.png?raw=true" width="50%">
</p>

Btw, DocArray is a powerful and easy-to-use data structure for unstructured data. It is super productive for data scientists who work in cross-/multi-modal domain. To learn more about DocArray, [please check out the docs](https://docs.jina.ai).

## Server

You can host your own server by following the instruction below.

### Hardware requirements

DALL·E Flow needs one GPU with 21GB VRAM at its peak. All services are squeezed into this one GPU, this includes (roughly)
- DALLE ~9GB
- GLID Diffusion ~6GB
- SwinIR ~3GB
- CLIP ViT-L/14-336px ~3GB

The following reasonable tricks can be used for further reducing VRAM:
- SwinIR can be moved to CPU (-3GB)
- CLIP can be delegated to [CLIP-as-service demo server](https://github.com/jina-ai/clip-as-service#text--image-embedding) (-3GB)


It requires at least 40GB free space on the hard drive, mostly for downloading pretrained models.

High-speed internet is required. Slow/unstable internet may throw frustrating timeout when downloading models.

CPU-only environment is not tested and likely won't work. Google Colab is likely throwing OOM hence also won't work.


### Server architecture

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/jina-ai/dalle-flow/blob/main/.github/flow.svg?raw=true" width="70%">
</p>

If you have installed Jina, the above flowchart can be generated via:

```bash
# pip install jina
jina export flowchart flow.yml flow.svg
```

### Run in Docker

We have provided [a Dockerfile](https://github.com/jina-ai/dalle-flow/blob/main/Dockerfile) which allows you to run a server out of the box.

Our Dockerfile is using CUDA 11.6 as the base image, you may want to adjust it according to your system.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jina-ai/dalle-flow.git
cd dalle-flow

docker build --build-arg GROUP_ID=$(id -g ${USER}) --build-arg USER_ID=$(id -u ${USER}) -t jinaai/dalle-flow .
```

The building will take 10 minutes with average internet speed, which results in a 10GB Docker image.

To run it, simply do:

```bash
docker run -p 51005:51005 -v $HOME/.cache:/home/dalle/.cache --gpus all jinaai/dalle-flow
```

- The first run will take ~10 minutes with average internet speed.
- `-v $HOME/.cache:/root/.cache` avoids repeated model downloading on every docker run.
- The first part of `-p 51005:51005` is your host public port. Make sure people can access this port if you are serving publicly. The second par of it is [the port defined in flow.yml](https://github.com/jina-ai/dalle-flow/blob/e7e313522608668daeec1b7cd84afe56e5b19f1e/flow.yml#L4).

You should see the screen like following once running:

</p>

Note that unlike running natively, running inside Docker may give less vivid progressbar, color logs, and prints. This is due to the limitations of the terminal in a Docker container. It does not affect the actual usage.

### Run natively

Running natively requires some manual steps, but it is often easier to debug.

#### Clone repos

```bash
mkdir dalle && cd dalle
git clone https://github.com/jina-ai/dalle-flow.git
git clone https://github.com/JingyunLiang/SwinIR.git
git clone https://github.com/CompVis/latent-diffusion.git
git clone https://github.com/hanxiao/glid-3-xl.git
```

You should have the following folder structure:

```text
dalle/
 |
 |-- dalle-flow/
 |-- SwinIR/
 |-- glid-3-xl/
 |-- latent-diffusion/
```

#### Install auxiliary repos

```bash
cd latent-diffusion && pip install -e . && cd -
cd glid-3-xl && pip install -e . && cd -
```

There are couple models we need to download for GLID-3-XL:

```bash
cd glid-3-xl
wget https://dall-3.com/models/glid-3-xl/bert.pt
wget https://dall-3.com/models/glid-3-xl/kl-f8.pt
wget https://dall-3.com/models/glid-3-xl/finetune.pt
cd -
```

#### Install flow

```bash
cd dalle-flow
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Start the server

Now you are under `dalle-flow/`, run the following command: 

```bash
jina flow --uses flow.yml
```

You should see this screen immediately:

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/jina-ai/dalle-flow/blob/main/.github/server-onstart.png?raw=true" width="50%">
</p>

On the first start it will take ~8 minutes for downloading the DALL·E mega model and other necessary models. The proceeding runs should only take ~1 minute to reach the success message.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/jina-ai/dalle-flow/blob/main/.github/server-wait.png?raw=true" width="50%">
</p>


When everything is ready, you will see:

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/jina-ai/dalle-flow/blob/main/.github/server-success.png?raw=true" width="50%">
</p>


Congrats! Now you should be able to [run the client](#client).

You can modify and extend the server flow as you like, e.g. changing the model, adding persistence, or even auto-posting to Instagram/OpenSea. With Jina and DocArray, you can easily make DALL·E Flow [cloud-native and ready for production](https://github.com/jina-ai/jina).
